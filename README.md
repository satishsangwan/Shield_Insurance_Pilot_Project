# Shield Insurance Pilot Project - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
As a Data Analyst intern at AtliQ Technologies, I completed this pilot project for **Shield Insurance**, focusing on customer and revenue analysis. The goal of this project was to provide insights into customer growth, revenue trends, and policy analysis to support business decision-making. This project showcases my ability to translate business requirements into meaningful data visualizations using Power BI.

### Project Scope
The project required me to analyze key metrics such as:
- Total customers and revenue
- Daily revenue growth rate and customer growth rate
- Monthly changes in policies
- Segmentation of customers by age group and city
- Sales mode analysis

**Key Deliverables:**
- A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard with 5 pages:
  - **Home Page**: Overview of the dashboard with key insights
  - **General View**: Trends in customers and revenue, with a toggle between graphs
  - **Sales Mode Analysis**: Analysis of sales mode preferences and trends
  - **Age Group Analysis**: Revenue and customer segmentation based on age groups
  - **Top/Bottom Analysis**: Insight into the top-performing and least-performing categories

## Data Sources
The analysis was performed on data from **five CSV files** provided by Shield Insurance, including customer, date, policy, premium, and settlement data. Below is a summary of each file:

1. **dim_customer.csv**: Contains customer details like customer code, date of birth, and city.
2. **dim_date.csv**: Provides date-related data including daily, monthly, and week number information.
3. **dim_policies.csv**: Holds information about policies such as policy ID, base cover, and premium amount.
4. **fact_premiums.csv**: Contains premium data such as sales date, policy ID, and sales mode.
5. **fact_settlements.csv**: Data on policy settlements segmented by age.
