# Shield Insurance Pilot Project - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
As a Data Analyst intern at AtliQ Technologies, I completed this pilot project for **Shield Insurance**, focusing on customer and revenue analysis. The goal of this project was to provide insights into customer growth, revenue trends, and policy analysis to support business decision-making. This project showcases my ability to translate business requirements into meaningful data visualizations using Power BI.

### Project Scope
The project required me to analyze key metrics such as:
- Total customers and revenue
- Daily revenue growth rate and customer growth rate
- Monthly changes in policies
- Segmentation of customers by age group and city
- Sales mode analysis

**Key Deliverables:**
- A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard with 5 pages:
  - **Home Page**: Overview of the dashboard with key insights
  - **General View**: Trends in customers and revenue, with a toggle between graphs
  - **Sales Mode Analysis**: Analysis of sales mode preferences and trends
  - **Age Group Analysis**: Revenue and customer segmentation based on age groups
  - **Top/Bottom Analysis**: Insight into the top-performing and least-performing categories

## Data Sources
The analysis was performed on data from **five CSV files** provided by Shield Insurance, including customer, date, policy, premium, and settlement data. Below is a summary of each file:

1. **dim_customer.csv**: Contains customer details like customer code, date of birth, and city.
2. **dim_date.csv**: Provides date-related data including daily, monthly, and week number information.
3. **dim_policies.csv**: Holds information about policies such as policy ID, base cover, and premium amount.
4. **fact_premiums.csv**: Contains premium data such as sales date, policy ID, and sales mode.
5. **fact_settlements.csv**: Data on policy settlements segmented by age.

## Key Features & Metrics
In this project, I identified 17 key features necessary for complete business analysis, such as:
- Total customers
- Total revenue
- Daily revenue growth rate
- Policy changes month-over-month
- Customer segmentation by city and age group
- Sales mode trend analysis

## Project Workflow

1. **Feature List Creation**: Created a list of 17 key metrics essential for analyzing Shield Insurance's performance and tracking key business metrics.
   
2. **Mockup Dashboard**: Developed a mockup dashboard that incorporated Shield Insuranceâ€™s feedback. This provided a clear layout for three pages: General View, Sales Mode Analysis, and Age Group Analysis.

3. **Final Dashboard**: Delivered a comprehensive, interactive Power BI dashboard with 5 pages. The dashboard allows dynamic filtering based on factors like sales mode, city, month, and policy ID. It provides an easy-to-navigate user interface for exploring key metrics.

## Dashboard Pages Breakdown

### 1. **Home Page**  
   A summary of key KPIs including total customers and revenue with navigation to other pages.

### 2. **General View**  
   A comparison of customer growth and revenue growth, including a toggle to switch between trends.

### 3. **Sales Mode Analysis**  
   Insights on sales modes (e.g., Online vs Offline) to understand customer behavior and revenue sources.

### 4. **Age Group Analysis**  
   Segments customers by age group, showcasing their contribution to revenue, policy settlements, and sales mode preferences.

### 5. **Top/Bottom Analysis**  
   Highlights top-performing and underperforming customer segments, sales modes, and policies.

## Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and transformed data from various sources to make it ready for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Created dynamic and interactive visualizations in Power BI, allowing users to toggle between graphs and filter data by sales mode, city, age group, and more.
- **Business Insights**: Delivered actionable insights to Shield Insurance, helping them monitor revenue, customer growth, and policy preferences over time.
- **Project Management**: Worked closely with Shield Insurance stakeholders to iteratively build a dashboard that meets their requirements and exceeds expectations.

## Tools & Technologies Used
